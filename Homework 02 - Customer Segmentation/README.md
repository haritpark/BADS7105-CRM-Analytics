# Customer Segmentation
## Import Dataset
Supermarket dataset is the public dataset that contains 956,574 records and 22 attributes. 
## Prepare customer view and Generate features
This step have to aggregate data from transaction level to customer level and generate some useful features in the model. For the category features need to transform to bu dummy variables.
For the final features be generated are 26 features
## Data Exploration
Explore the features in the model
